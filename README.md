## Task 0: Navigation System

Setup a navigation system which routes to 4 pages representing individual tasks. Also, include a "404 not found" page for nonexistent routes.

## Task 1: Circle Counter

At the center of the page, add a circle with a diameter of 10% of the screen size. Place 2 buttons below the circle.

### Circle

- The circle should start with a yellow background.
- Display a counter (number) starting from 0 in the center.
- Show the current background color below the counter.

### Button 1

- On click, this button should increase the counter by 1.
- Change the background color of its respective circle to a random color.

### Button 2

- On click, duplicate the circle exactly as it is, placing the duplicate to the right.
- Reset the counters of both circles to 0.

**Note:** Allow a maximum of 10 circles on the screen, arranged in 2 centered rows. Each circle's color and counter should only affect its respective circle and not others.

## Task 2: Fetch User Data

Using the number of circles displayed on page 1, fetch data from a provided API for that many users. Display their ID, Full Name, Avatar, and title on individual cards using a grid system. Clicking on any card will navigate to the third page.

## Task 3: User Details

Display all the details of the selected user from the previous page. Implement a clean design and use centralized state management for the data.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
